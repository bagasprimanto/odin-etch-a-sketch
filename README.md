#Etch A Sketch

Etch a Sketch is an app where you can draw stuff on a grid of squares by hovering your mouse. It was a fascinating project as this was my first time actually creating an interactive web page!

Try hovering your mouse over the squares and see what happens!

##What I learned
In this project I learned how to do the following:
1. Use JavaScript to create new HTML elements
2. Use JavaScript to add new HTML elements to the DOM
3. Use JavaScript to add event listeners on HTML elements to trigger events that change the CSS properties of an HTML element
4. Use CSS flexbox to lay out HTML elements on the page
